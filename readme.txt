entered through your contact forms in real time to prevent fake inquiries from fake emails addresses. 
The email validator plugin comes packed with several features that help you  

* Check the syntax of the email entered, to quickly flag invalid email format to the visitor

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= In Disposable Email Detection, what is the difference between the static list and the dynamic list? =
The static list consists of a fixed set of disposable email vendors while the dynamic list gets updated with new vendors as a when they are discovered

= Why should I subscribe to the premium email validation plugin and not just use the free version? =
The free version does provide the essential features needed to prevent fake sign-ups, but the validation is based on a static list of disposable email vendors. New disposable email vendors pop up frequently and the existing vendors come up with new domains too. So with the premium email validation plugin you can ensure your list stays updated and you have better levels of protection

= I am not technical, how easy is it to setup the plugin? =
The plugin works out of the box with the major forms out there, and you donot need to be tech savvy at all to setup the plugin. Once you install and activate the plugin from the plugin store, you would be presented check boxes to select your preferences. Thatâ€™s it, you are all set..

= Is there any other cost outside of $2/month? =
Nope, it's a $2/month flat fee for email validation without any restriction on the number of queries that can be made. Please do-not confuse this with email verification, our service uses a combination of methods to ascertain the validity of the emails but does-not do the end-point verification if the email exists. A full fledged email verification system is in the works and we expect to release the functionality in the near future

= What if my site is not on WordPress but I would still like to use your services? =
Apart from the plugin we have a well functioning API service that can be integrated in to any website or a form. Have a look at our Email Validation API at https://www.antideo.com/email-validation/

= Do you have access to, or store the email addresses being validated through the plugin? =
We have built mechanisms to validate the email addresses within the plugin itself without a need for the email address to be sent out to our database, so in short we never access your prospect's/customer's email address. You do however have an option to build your own blacklist within the plugin, which is passed on to us to alert our users of the scammer/spammers. This crowdsourced list would help us provide better security to our users
